# Wrek's - Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases my projects and "skills" as a developer.

## 🚀 About Me

As a Navy veteran, tech enthusiast, and devoted family man,
                 I bring a unique perspective to the world of innovative 
                 technology. My seven years of leadership in the military, 
                 combined with my degrees in Computer Science and Cognitive 
                 Science from Columbia University, have equipped me with a 
                 diverse skill set that bridges practical experience with 
                 cutting-edge knowledge. I'm passionate about leveraging AI, 
                 machine learning, and other advanced technologies to enhance 
                 human potential across various sectors. My background includes 
                 leading cross-functional teams in high-pressure environments, 
                 developing AI-driven systems, and creating blockchain solutions 
                 for secure data management. As a father of two with two dogs, 
                 I understand firsthand the impact that thoughtful innovation 
                 can have on everyday life. My goal is to contribute to projects 
                 that not only push the boundaries of technology but also make a 
                 tangible difference in people's lives and capabilities. I'm 
                 excited to bring my unique blend of military discipline, 
                 technical expertise, and innovative thinking to organizations 
                 that are committed to using technology to create a better 
                 future for all.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on this portfolio and a regulatory enhancement system
- 🌱 I'm currently learning basically everything, but Data Analytics tools and brushing up on 
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on disruptive and innovative tech
- 💬 Ask me about anything from my time in the military, Columbia University undergrad in my 30's, being a father, the MN Vikings, Video games, intellectual stimulation, and trying to make the world a better place
